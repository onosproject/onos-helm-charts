# ONOS Helm charts

This repository contains helm charts for the different ÂµONOS services and overarching helm charts for a set of microservices yielding a full control plane deployment.
Each folder contains the helm chart of that specific project. e.g. `onos-config` folder contains the `onos-config` helm chart. 

The overarching helm chart to deploy `micro-onos` is in the `onos` folder. 

The `micro-onos` project provides [step by step documentation]() on how to deploy a whole `micro-onos` with Helm.
You can also deploy each sevice separately by following the the `How to deploy with Helm` documentation contained 
in each service. For example [this]() is the `onos-config` one.
